# pyframe

An asynchronous Python API wrapper for [the Warframestat API](https://hub.warframestat.us) and (later) [the warframe.market API](https://warframe.market/api_docs).

# What to expect

This library is in its *very* early states. I am willing to spend a long time on this project to make it the best and most up-to-date Python Warframe API wrapper.

# TODO

Model refactor:

- Refactor invasions as soon as the endpoint is fixed, if it's an endpoint problem

Else:

- Implement all models/endpoints
endpoints
- Implement Item- hierarchy and types:

  - Item class inherits from WorldstateObject and MultiQueryModel
  - Put all major infos in the Item class (split them later)
